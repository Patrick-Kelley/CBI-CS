Cybersecurity Burnout Inventory - Cybersecurity Edition (CBI-CS)
================================================================

This repository contains materials related to the **Cybersecurity Burnout Inventory – Cybersecurity Edition (CBI-CS)**. The content is designed to assist cybersecurity professionals and organizations in assessing, managing, and mitigating burnout risks within their workforce.

Why We Transitioned
-------------------

The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) requires a paid license for use in training, distribution, and modification. To remain compliant while supporting the cybersecurity community, we have transitioned to the open-access Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI), creating the CBI-CS.

What is the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory?
-----------------------------------------

The CBI measures burnout across:

*   **Personal Burnout**
    
*   **Work-Related Burnout**
    
*   **Client-Related Burnout** (adapted here for stakeholder and end-user interactions in cybersecurity)
    

It uses a 19-item questionnaire, is license-free, and aligns with research-backed burnout assessments.

Repository Contents
-------------------

*   **CBI-CS\_Burnout\_Calculator.xlsx** – Tool to calculate the potential cost of burnout.
    
*   **CBI-CS\_Questionnaire.docx** – Questionnaire for assessment.
    
*   **CBI-CS\_Training\_Guide.docx** – Guide for training leaders and HR.
    
*   **Instruction Package for Administering CBI-CS.docx** – Instructions for accurate administration.
